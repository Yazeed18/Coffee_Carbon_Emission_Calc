## Note: Numbers and values do not reflect any actual data and are arbitrarily chosen for the purpose of this repo. 

- Responsive website built using PHP as the backend with HTML/CSS as the frontend. 

- The website takes in basic user inputs about their coffee order and displays detailed information of the Carbon footprint of their coffee in the form of a table.

- The input boxes have restrictions on them where the user can only enter a maximum of 4 characters. These characters can only be numbers (0-9) as well one decimal point such that it is a proper floating point number. 

- The inputs are also remembered upon submission meaning if the user wants to make a slight change to their order they can do so easily without having to re-enter their order.
